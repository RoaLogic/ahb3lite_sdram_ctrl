\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The Roa Logic \emph{AHB-Lite Multi-layer Interconnect Switch}, hereafter referred to as 'the Interconnect', is a fully parameterized high performance, low latency interconnect fabric soft IP for AHB-Lite.
It allows a virtually unlimited number of AHB-Lite bus masters and
slaves to be connected without the need for bus arbitration to be
implemented by the bus masters. Instead, slave side arbitration is
implemented for each slave port within the core.

The Interconnect supports priority based and round-robin based
arbitration when multiple bus masters request access to the same slave
port. Typically arbitration completes within 1 clock cycle.
